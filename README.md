# Blackjack Web Game — Classic Blackjack by Deividas Strole

Blackjack Web Game is a fully functional, single-file Blackjack game built entirely with vanilla **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**. Developed by Deividas Strole, this browser-based project implements classic Blackjack rules: hit, stand, dealer plays to 17, proper Ace handling (11 or 1), and immediate win detection for natural Blackjack.

Hosted directly on GitHub Pages, it's a lightweight, no-dependency web app perfect for quick play or as a learning example of pure front-end game development.

This project, created by Deividas Strole, demonstrates clean code structure, DOM manipulation, game logic, and modern styling—all in one `index.html` file.

🚀 Overview

Enjoy the thrill of Blackjack right in your browser. The dealer shows one card, you get two—decide to Hit or Stand, aiming to get closer to 21 than the dealer without busting. The game features a sleek gradient background, animated card hover effects, hidden dealer card, real-time scoring, and persistent win/loss/tie stats.

Built by Deividas Strole as a portfolio piece showcasing vanilla JS game development.
